                I have been recently studying SQL and have completed a university assignment in which I was tasked with creating, populating and overall using SQL to maniplate data within a database. It was quite easy to understand and I plan on using SQL in later personal/university
                projects. I used phpMyAdmin to manage the SQL server.

                This week I took on a project that implemented databases. The project was coded in Java, and for the database aspect I used mySQL server & SQL Workbench. The project itself was quite simple as it performed user validation to check whether the user attempting
                to login was a registered user or not, if the latter, the user was able to sign up with their own unique sign in credentials. Overall, I would say I am satisfied with the outcome of the program, as it is my first time working with databases.
